    "text": " This is Elon Musk's Flamethrower. I'm going to try to build an expensive looking website for it using Google's latest vibe coding platform, anti-gravity, but I'm only allowed 20 minutes to do it. I don't know how to code and I'm not using fancy copy or design skills. I'm going to build it live step by step and when the timer ends we'll see if simple and fast can still look premium. Let's dive in. This is a site I found. I just use a site like Beans, which is really great for getting inspiration for design and things like that. I found this really cool website for this social media marketing studio with this octopus and these cool like card callouts and these really nice graphics and big text and I just thought this was cool and like a cool vibe. So I wanted to see if we could take Elon Musk's Flamethrower and build a landing page and marketing site kind of in this style. So here we are inside of anti-gravity. If you've never used this before and you still need to install it just come over to anti-gravity.google and you can come down here, install this to your system and then just sign in with your Google name and password. Now this is where most people get stuck. Just to make sure you're familiar the right side here this is your agent. This is where you're going to do all of your planning and communicating. You can use a couple of different models like Gemini 3 or Quad. You can see how the exclamation point because I've used all my Quad credits. So we're going to use Gemini 3 today and in order to get started this is where most people get stuck. You actually need to be inside of a folder on your machine. So I have this anti-gravity template that I like to use. It has a couple of my setup files and some of the skills that I keep coming back to over and over again. I'll explain what skills are in just a minute. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to duplicate this and I'm going to call it Flame Thor because that's what we are working on today. Now just click open folder inside of anti-gravity. I'm going to come over into the template that I just created, the Flame Thor file right here. Go ahead, click open, you can see allow this and I trust the author of this file. Yes, I trust this and you can see here that this has the same file structure that we just saw with our agents, our readme file and some of the skills. If you want to get access to this template, you can just come over into the community, go ahead, click down into the resources, download this for yourself and start working with this today. First thing that we're going to access to setup everything completely is this agents.md file. I'm going to have anti-gravity set up the rest of our files for us while I explain to you exactly what this is doing. I can just go ahead and type the at symbol which will bring up any of the files that we have inside of our system. We can just access this agents.md file and really simply I can just go ahead and say set up. And what it's going to do is it's going to read through this agents file and it's going to set up the rest of our files and folders in according to the instructions that we have given it. So there are a couple of things that you need to know inside of this agents file. So first is this three layer architecture which is the DOE framework which stands for directive, orchestration and execution. And these three pieces all work together. So directive is basically just the directions that you are giving the system. And then it's going to move to the orchestration level which is basically the job of the agent. So take the direction and tell the system exactly how to execute on it. And then from there it's going to actually create all of the scripts and things like that that is actually going to need to build whatever it is that we're asking it to build. We can see here I've analyzed the current directory and I'm ready to set up the three layer architecture as described. I'm just going to go ahead and click proceed and then the system is going to get to work and you'll see on the left hand side over here in just a couple of seconds it'll start creating files for us. The next thing that's really powerful about anti-gravity and these systems right now is the self annealing loop. And this is going to save you so much time in troubleshooting or fixing problems. Basically this just means if you encounter an error fix it go ahead do the research figure out why it's wrong or why it's not working. Have a conversation with yourself and figure out what the issue is and then just fix it. So it's no longer relying completely on the human to fix something that's broken. And this last part here is the directory structure. This is what it's setting up right now. Tempt files, the execution and directive folders which we just talked about and the environment file which basically stores any of our API keys or things like that. And now we can see here that we've basically created directives and executions, the environment file, any requirements and we are all ready to go to start building. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get any information we need about this Flamethrower. So if I come over I search Google for Elon Musk Flamethrower. I can come into images here just open this one up go ahead right click save this image as and I'm just going to come into our anti-gravity folder here go into Flamethrower and I'm just going to type Flamethrower image go ahead click save and you can see it saved this web P file and if we come back into anti-gravity it's already in the system because this is just live and accessing all of the files in that folder. The next thing is I'm going to do is I'll just come back to all and I'm just going to grab the information here just so we have any kind of reference for text because we want to build like a sales or marketing type website. So just a little information is good. What's pretty cool is we can start talking to the system or telling you what we need. So first I'm going to paste in that information that we just got and then I'm just going to talk to the system and say here's some information about Elon Musk's Flamethrower. I just want you to put this in a text file also perform any additional research on the internet that might be helpful for us in order to create like a sales and marketing website any statistics any consumer response anything that might be valuable. And now I can send this off and the system is going to work Gemini 3 and anti-gravity are so powerful because it's not just a coder it's also searches the internet and will do research for you. So it's really really powerful. In the meantime let me show you what else we can do with this. This is a site I found I just use a site like Beans which is really great for getting inspiration for design and things like that. I found this really cool website for this social media marketing studio with this octopus and these cool like card call outs and these really nice graphics and big text and I just thought this was cool and like a cool vibe. So I want to see if we could take Elon Musk's Flamethrower and build a landing page and marketing site kind of in this style. There are a couple of different ways to go about this but I want to see if we can do this by scraping the site itself. And if we run into any issues I'll show you how we can kind of get around it. There's a great website called Firecrawl which allows you to scrape the internet for just about anything. I'll leave a link in the description where you can sign up and get started. What's really cool is if you come into the playground here you can put in any website that you want so I'm just going to use the website for my agency as an example. I'm just going to copy this. Come back into Firecrawl we can go ahead and press paste but what's pretty cool is that down here we can actually select branding. So now if I click start scraping what this is going to do is just going to pull in all of the data from the website as well as any of the brand information. So you can see this is all the text and stuff from the site itself in Markdown format but if I click on branding you can see it brought in our logo it brought in the little icon it pulled in all the color palettes and the fonts and things like that. So we can start using this information to build a brand new site. Obviously I said I wanted us to do this in the style of this octopus website so we're going to use this site instead but instead of using Firecrawl directly in the browser I'm going to go ahead and use this inside of anti-gravity and while I was yapping you can see that anti-gravity just went ahead and did all this research for us and if I opened this document it went ahead and created an executive summary about the company the price all the sales the revenue any context that I provided here the purpose and design some information about sales and demographics so there's so much information that this research for us while we were doing other things and so what we're going to end up doing we're going to take the image of the flame though we're going to take the style of the octopus website we're going to take all of this information here that we just researched we're going to put it all together to build a brand new site using anti-gravity no coding in on our own no design work on our own we're going to see what the system can do I can come back over into this octo website and I'm going to copy this URL and if I come back into anti-gravity I have a set of skills setup and what skills are are basically a set of instructions now I'm just going to go into this brand extractor so you can see these are just standard operating procedures if there's something that you know you're doing over and over again or if there's a specific process that you like to go through for something to happen it's really helpful to build these skills that way the system isn't guessing and you can go through a repeatable process every single time so you can get really predictable outcomes and results so I created this brand extractor skill which is basically going to use the fire crawl API it's going to get the URL it's going to scrape any of the branding any of the images any of the colors the typography things like that automatically and pull it into the system and update our brand guidelines skill so now we can reference our brand guidelines when creating new things these skills can live globally and it's really impactful if you're creating something like brand guidelines and you're going to be building out multiple sites you can reference the same brand guidelines over and over again rather than having to build them uniquely every single time so what we can do is I can come in here into the agent I can type at and skill and I have this brand extractor skill I can just paste a link to the website and I'm going to give it a little more context because I know behands is particular because it's not the actual octopus website itself it's just kind of like a gallery of sorts focus on the octo sm website I want you to pull in any images you can find on the site to make sure that we have everything we need to focus on the brand colors and typography I know that the pink coral color is kind of the main color that we see so I give it a little bit of extra context and again I'm going to send this off and let's see when anti gravity comes back with so while this is thinking one other thing we can do is we can start creating additional assets if we think we might need them there's a really great tool called whisk it's also by Google just come over to this website right here go ahead click enter tool and this is a great playground for generating new images so I'm going to come over into the left side here just expand this out and we want for the subject we want that image that we downloaded so I'm going to come into the flamethrower folder I'm going to bring in the flamethrower and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to describe what I want this to look like product photography shot flamethrower at a three quarter angle on a solid black background I know our size probably going to be black right now this is on a white background so I want to make sure we have something that blends in but we're going to take it one step further so you can see in just a couple of seconds we generated some new images which is pretty cool what's great about whisk is I can just add animation to this from the side itself so I can click animate here and I'm just going to say flames you met from the nozzle and encircle the flamethrower completely while this is generating I'm going to come back into anti gravity to see what happened so we can see here the fire crawl API key is missing from the environment this makes sense so you can come back into fire crawl go to your dashboard here and just come into API keys gonna go ahead and click create and I'm just going to type flamethrower so now we have a brand new API key to work with and in just a couple of seconds we have a new API key I can copy this from here come back into anti gravity and just type in fire crawl underscore API underscore key then the equal sign and then paste in your API key after this and again make sure that you're in this dot AMV file this is a file that lives locally it's not stored anywhere else so you don't have to worry about anyone accessing your data now I've pasted in my API key I'm going to go ahead and click proceed in the meantime we can go back over to whisk and this is the video it created for us obviously it's a bit ridiculous but it's Elon Musk's flamethrower so I'm kind of okay with it we can go ahead and click download this is going to download the mp4 but for our case since this further web what's also great about whisk is we can download an animated gif super cool really small file format great for the web so back inside of anti gravity I can just come into the download folder and you can see we have this gif here that it created for us and I can just go ahead and drag this into our files over here so we have access to it and I can even rename it from here I can just say fire dot gif awesome so it's so powerful about these systems as you can see it's this ability to bounce back and forth between tasks so you're able to execute on some things while the system executes on others the system created all these new brand assets for us so if I come into brand guidelines I'm going to click accept you can see it actually used the point coral as our primary brand color has a secondary color palette of deep maroon and dark plum and then if we come in here it actually pulled in all of these images from the site that we have to work with so this is already super crazy powerful now we're going to do something really fun right here because we're in google we also have access to nano banana pro google's latest AI image generator which is extremely powerful it's the best image generator on the market right now we can use it right inside of anti gravity so I can come in here and type flamethrower dot web p just to make sure that we're accessing the actual flamethrower image that we downloaded and I'm just going to tell the system what I want the first thing I need you to do is analyze any of the project underscore image files inside of the brand assets folder to get a sense of the style I want you to understand how they treat heroes I can see there's high contrast with a strong single light pink is the primary color and anything else that might be helpful in generating new images once you understand this I want you to send the flamethrower dot web p file to google nano banana pro or Gemini 3 pro preview to generate brand new images for our website they should match the style of the reference images you can see it's analyzing the existing brand assets and then it's just going to get to work generating brand new images for us using nano banana pro it's actually crazy what you can do now all in a single place so we can see that this generated some brand new images for us in just a couple of seconds these are a great start but I want even more and I think we can do these better we should make sure that the pink coral hue is kind of the main tint of all these images and definitely some of these images should have fire in them probably some people using the flamethrower just to make sure we have a good variety I did end up hitting a rate limit here honestly I'm not sure why that happened I'm not going to bother to figure it out right now but I did have a few more assets that I generated that you can see here that are moved into this site assets folder on the left hand side here like this pretty cool schematic of the flamethrower itself now we have everything we need to actually tell anti gravity to build the site we have all of this context about the flamethrower itself we have all of the images that we just generated we have information about the brand guidelines from the octo site we even have the octo reference images that we can use to base our new landing page and any additional context that the system found about Elon Musk's flamethrower so let's have the system get to work I need you to build a high converting landing page for the flamethrower make sure to incorporate any of the not a flamethrower context.md file use the project underscore images as reference for the design layout using pink coral as the main color using our site assets images that we created we want to match that styling with kind of like big text any of the different types of cards that it uses in the reference images match the typography and styling as best you can and I'm just going to go ahead and replace some of what it got here with the not a flamethrower context.md and you know what I'm not even going to bother filling out the rest of those let's see what the system can find on its own one thing I really like about anti gravity that's super cool is it actually creates these implementation plans for you as a human so I can go ahead and review what it's planning to do before the system actually gets to work and something that's even more powerful about it is if you want if you're not happy with any of these plans you can just go ahead and come in here let's say global variables for the color we could come in here we could actually leave a comment on this too to say like make sure we also include neon green which is my brand color and we can say double zero zero ff zero zero that's my hex code for that neon green just to make sure that it has this information too and so now we can actually review the implementation plan provide feedback to the system that it's then going to incorporate before it actually starts building for us we can see here that it actually made the update to the plan right here global variables for the pink coral and the neon green color in just a couple of minutes we have this brand new site for Elon's flame there are already to go including our gifts including these cards including all of the images that we generated and things like that the schematic the specs is it perfect no of course it is not perfect but you can continue to have a back and forth with anti gravity to make any of the changes that you want now during the process I did find that it is helpful to go in with a little bit more of a game plan of how you want to build this if you want to use basic HTML and CSS if you want to use react and tailwind and all those things so actually working with anti gravity first to create a stronger game plan of the implementation steps will actually save you a lot of troubleshooting in the long run
