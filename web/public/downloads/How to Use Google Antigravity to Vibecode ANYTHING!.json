    "text": " Every AI tutorial makes it look easy, open the tool, type a prompt, and everything just works. But the moment you're staring at a blank project, most people get stuck and never ship anything real. Today we're not just setting things up, we're using the latest vibe coding platform from Google, anti-gravity to build a fully functioning dashboard for Mr. Beast and his chocolate brand Feastables. If you're new here, my name's Duncan, I'm a former art director at Apple, PlayStation, and Nissan, and now I run my own AI agency and teach others how to make money building and selling AI and automations. In this video, I'll show you how to use an agent's file to set up anti-gravity the right way and how to create reusable skills to save you time, increase efficiency, and create repeatable, predictable outputs every time. If you want AI projects that actually look professional, not just demos, this is where everything clicks. So what I want to do today is I want to go ahead and scrape the Mr. Beast Feastables website and create a dashboard of some fake sales data for him to track the sales of all of his chocolate bars. And I want to do this with his branding and his styling all built in automatically. And one of the things I want you to understand is that ideally we'll be setting up systems and files so you can build your own templates that you can come back to over and over again. Here we are inside of anti-gravity. When you first open it up, it's going to look like this. If you've never installed anti-gravity before, all you have to do is come over to anti-gravity.google.gohead and download this for your system, run the installer and then sign in with your Google name and password. So once you open it up, it's going to look like this. In order to get started, you need to actually be inside of a folder on your system. So I'm just going to go ahead and click open folder, head over to my desktop, go ahead, click create, and I'll just call this Beast Dash because we're going to be making a dashboard today for Feastables by Mr. Beast. And we can go ahead and click open. Now your system is all set up and ready to go. And honestly, this is where most people get stuck. So the right side here, this is your agent. This is where you actually talk to anti-gravity. You can use a variety of models, quad, Gemini. I recommend either quad 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro. Over here is going to be all of your folders and files. We don't have anything in here yet, but we will have anti-gravity set this all up for us. Now one thing I recommend is actually having an entire template folder set up for you that you can just copy and paste every time you want to start a new project. This contains any of your setup information and any of your skills, which I'm actually going to tell you about these today and how you can build them out for yourself. One thing I do want to grab is this agents.md file. This is basically the instructions for how anti-gravity should set up your system. If you want to get access to this for free, I'll just leave a link in the description where you can download this. Real quick, full disclosure, I got this agents file from Nick Sarayev, who's one of the goats when it comes to AI and automations. He gives this away for free so I don't think he'd mind me sharing it with you, but definitely check out his stuff if you haven't already. Now I know some people might be mad about that, but I learned a long time ago to not be a purist. If there is something out there available to you that will help you get your work done faster or more efficiently or better, go ahead and use it. He's done a great job building out this system, this three-layer architecture that self-heeled, self-corrects, troubleshoots for you, everything you absolutely need to get started. I'm passing along that information to you. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to select all of this. I'm going to copy this over. I'm going to come back into our other folder here, our Beast-folder, and I'm going to go ahead and just click this plus right here and we will call this agents.md and I'm just going to go ahead and paste this all in here and this tripped me up the first time. Make sure you hit save on your computer, command-ass or control-ass to actually save this, otherwise the system won't recognize it. This is the file that sets up your computer. What we can do is we can actually have anti-gravity set up the proper folder structure for us without us having to do anything while I walk you through exactly how the system works. So what's pretty cool is you can actually reference specific files just by hitting the app button. So if I just start typing an ad and then start typing an agent, I can just go ahead and select this file and I can just use this fancy word instantiate which basically just means like go, like set up everything according to these directions. So you can see here this is starting to think it's going to go ahead. It's going to read through these instructions and set up all of our files for us. Let's go into these instructions so you understand how the system works before we get to building some cool stuff. There's basically two bang things that you need to understand which is the three layer architecture. So it's the DOE framework that's directive, orchestration and execution. So the directive is basically like just the instructions that you are giving the system. So exactly how you want the system to behave. The orchestration which is basically the job of this agent is to actually understand the directions and then execute on them. So this layer it figures out for itself. And execution is any of the actual scripts it needs to execute on the tasks you've given it in the directions. And so these three kind of layers all work together. You can see here that anti-gravity has just finished up. You can see on the left here all of our new files and folders that it created which you probably saw building while I was talking. And these are just some best practices that you can use any time you want to set up your system. The other thing to understand about this that's really important is this self annealing thing. This is self anneal when things break. It means self heal, self correct, auto correct, fix your own errors, right? Meet your error messages, figure out where the errors are, go ahead, test it again, fix it, make sure it works. If it's not working, test it again and so on until it actually finds a solution for what you're trying to do. This alone will save you so much time troubleshooting. So what I want to do today is I want to go ahead and scrape the Mr. Beast Feastable's website and create a dashboard of some fake sales data for him to track the sales of all of his chocolate bars. And I want to do this with his branding and his styling all built in automatically. So there's a really cool site called FireCrawl. I'll leave a link in the description where you can get access. And if you come over to the playground, you can paste in any link from the internet and you can get all sorts of data from it. The thing I care most about right now is branding. So I'm just going to go ahead and click start scraping. And I'm going to show you how to do this in the browser right now. But what's actually really cool is we're going to build a skill designed to fetch branding from any website that we give it. So you can see in just a couple of seconds, it pulled in the logo, the little icon, the primary colors, the accent colors, all of the fonts and typography and things like that. So we can use this in our branding to build a dashboard that follows these guidelines. So that if we were going to give this to a client like Mr. Beast, it would feel familiar and recognizable and on brand. What I want to do is I want to build a skill for anti-gravity, which is a repeatable process that we can use not just in this workflow, but in future workflows to be able to use FireCrawl to pull branding from any site. So this idea of skills was basically created by Anthropic, the company behind quad, and it's basically just a file that teaches quad or an arcase anti-gravity how to do something specific. The reason skills are so powerful is that it saves you on processing and on tokens. And it's just something that it can read the instructions to have a very repeatable and consistent process. So there's no mistakes and no guessing. Now hang with me for a second. Anthropic has also released an entire GitHub repository full of skills to create brand guidelines to create canvases, docs, front end design to create gifts for Slack and a couple of other things. The one that we care about today is the skill creator. And I'm just going to go ahead and open this up and come in here really quick. So this is a meta skill. Basically, this skill allows you to create all other skills in a format that caught in other LLMs understand. So we can basically say, hey skill creator, I want you to create a skill that uses FireCrawl to pull branding information from any website and do this with it. And it'll follow this very predictable set of rules to create a skill that is actually reliable. If you come over to this website here, you can see there's no actual way to download this. But what's pretty cool is on GitHub, if you come into dot this dot com up here, we can just go ahead and change this to dot dev. And this is going to open this up in a web editor for us. We're actually going to be able to download all of the files from here. And so we have the skill creator over here. And I can just right click on this and come down to download and actually download this to the system. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come in to our beast dash folder. And I'm just going to select this right here. And I'm just going to download the skill creator to the folder that we're already using. And now again, if you're creating like a templated folder, put this in your template, and you can use this over and over again. So now if we come back into anti-gravity, you can see we have this new skill creator folder already in here. And what I actually want to do is I just want to go ahead and rename this really quick. So it's really clear what skill is which. And I'm just going to go ahead and call this skill underscore skill creator so that we can easily reference it. And now if I go ahead and type this type in at type in skill, we can come in here and actually call the skill creator to create new skills for us. And in this case, since we're using quad, I'm just going to switch this to quad. So on it, 4.5. I want to create a brand new skill that uses the fire crawl API to scrape a website and pull in any relevant brand data colors, typography, fonts. I also want to make sure we pull in any relevant or interesting images like header or hero images, logos, things like that. And also any information that might be helpful in building a new website like particular styling, effects, buttons, things like that. Here's some info on how to use the fire crawl API. So why these systems are so cool? Is there so freaking smart? I can come over to fire crawl. And there are fire crawl documentation, which basically tell you how to do everything. What I actually really like about the fire crawl site is they literally just have this copy button. You don't even need to understand what is going on on the site. There's a couple of things we need to know, like how to scrape a specific URL. And then if we scroll down here a little bit further, you can see how we actually extract the brand identity using some of this information. But what we can do is we can just come up to the top, go ahead and click copy the page, go back into anti-gravity, and just paste this in. And it has all the information it needs about how to use fire crawl properly to scrape the web, extract all of the branding data, and we are good to go. And so now what we're doing, you can see it is calling the skill creator, which is basically the set of instructions on how to create new skills in a predictable and reliable format is going to create a brand new skill for us all centered around brand extraction. And again, this is a skill we can use over and over again, not just in this project, but in future projects. So if we ever have multiple clients or a new client and we need to get information about their brand from their website, we can call this skill to extract all the information necessary and begin building from there. What's also cool about anti-gravity is you can actually leave comments to the system while it's running. So there's one thing I forgot I can say after the brand guidelines have been extracted, I want to create a new brand guidelines markdown file that we can reference. So I just sent this off and you can go ahead and say, add a comment that's just going to get cute. And so as soon as anti-gravity has like a break in its thinking, it's going to go ahead and look into your comments and then implement whatever it is that you told it to do. One other thing that I forgot is that anthropic actually already has this brand guidelines skill. So I can download this too and I can just go ahead and paste this inside of our beast guidelines. And now I can come back to anti-gravity. We can see we have this brand guidelines. You can see this is the skill that it has here. So let's just go ahead and rename this again. So it's clear and we'll just say brand guidelines. And so I just said update the brand guidelines skill with the extracted information and add any new info that was extracted as well. Because while this is pretty thorough, it has colors and accent colors and typography, it probably doesn't have things like the images and things like that. So we can see that this is analyzed the brand guidelines skill. It's an anthropic specific brand guidelines and I want them to update it to work with the extracted brand from the brand extractor skill. So we're going to have all of these systems functioning together. What's so important to understand is that setting up these foundations the right way are going to make your building so much faster and more efficient down the line. We're going to be able to build this dashboard insanely quickly. When other skill you should know about in the anthropic design file is this front end design. So this is a new skill in here that basically helps you create like non AI looking sites. This gives you a little bit more information on how to think like a designer, some aesthetics for designing like a really clean front end. So you can download this as well and save this in your file or save this in your template so that you have access to it always. So now we can work together with the front end designer, our brand guidelines to create a really compelling website. We can see it already has some built in things like color and theme and motion so we can actually add animation to our sites automatically how to create backgrounds and visual design. So again, anthropic has done a really nice job creating these skills for you that are creating this consistent repeatable process. So now if we come into this new brand extractor skill, you can see it has all of this information to basically extract comprehensive brand identity from websites using the fire crawl API. Really pretty impressive extracts logos color palettes, typography, any of the images, any design systems, any styling and effects like animation. So it's really, really thorough. This is very cool. Let's just go ahead and rename this again just to make sure that it's really clear which skill we're calling. Now we can actually use this skill. I'm going to come into our feasible website of the Cocoa story, come back into anti-gravity and I can say at skill brand extractor, let me scoot this over again, just paste in the link to that site and I can just say update and just say at skill again, the brand guidelines with the information that it found that's how simple it is. And now you can see why we spent so much time setting this up the right way in the first place. So you can see all extract brand data from the feasible website and update the brand guidelines. Let me start by running the extraction script. Now what's going to happen here is we're likely going to run into an error because we haven't actually given it our fire crawl API yet. You can see I need the fire crawl API key. Let me check to see if it's the environment or ask the user for it. Create a .nv file for me to store my API keys. Great. So what this one had and did is it created a .nv file for us and you can see that basically wants us to put our fire crawl API key in here. And so let me show you how to do that. So if I come back over to the web, I can go into fire crawl right here, come into my dashboard, go ahead and click API keys. And all you have to do is click create to create a brand new API key. I can just go ahead and call this B stash. And I'm just going to go ahead and click create key. We created this key successfully. It's all bored out. I'm just going to go ahead and click copy, come back in here and paste this directly into your environment file and then click save. I've added my key to the .nv file. Please proceed with the brand extraction. So this is awesome. It says the feasible brand data is now available for use in any project. So if I come in here, you can see we have all this information in brand data. We went ahead and actually pulled in all of these images from the feasible site, like the logo of these images, our store, you like, look at how cool this is. We have so much data we can work with now. We have all of these brand new brand guidelines in here, like the primary colors and the fonts, the font sizes, the background colors, everything we need really cool. And so now we can go ahead and take all this to build a super, super cool dashboard. There are ties the information in the brand underscore data folder, use at, we can see feasible brand guidelines and the images. I'm going to say also use the best practices in at tag another skill. We can go to the front end design skill. I want to create a clean modern dashboard focusing on the feasible brand to track sales of the feasible chocolate. Just create some fake sales data for now so that we can test this out. Make sure the entire dashboard fits on a single page and that there is a way for me to open this locally. You can see it's getting to work creating a modern feasible sales dashboard using the extracted brand data and front end design best practices. It's going to review the brand guidelines and the front end design skill. And now it's going to actually create this dashboard for us. If you want to get access to my setup folder that I use for everything, I'll leave a link in the description where you can join thousands of others learning how to make money with AI. In just a couple of minutes, we built an entire dashboard for feasible tracking the revenue, the unit. We have all these grass when we even brought in some of the product images you can see we have animation built directly into the site automatically. I did not code any of this. We have a regional breakdown performance metrics. Obviously, this is all fake data, but we could have this pull from a Google sheet or something else like that. But the point is that we have a pretty cool, usable site already to go in just a couple of minutes, not to mention a repeatable, predictable process that we can use to expand on the site and improve on it over time following the Mr. B's brand. If you thought this video was cool, you're definitely going to want to see how I use anti-gravity to convert my NADN automations into a Gen-to-Gwerk flow. So check out this video right here. I'll see you over there.",
