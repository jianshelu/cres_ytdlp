You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"7067b9c88a8df2e11477f0d661cbd0820b051dad","branch":"subtitle-karaoke-ass","repository_url":"https://github.com/jianshelu/ai-podcast-clipper-local.git"}}}

The tool uses different AI models to transcribe the video, automatically detect the most engaging moments in podcasts and create clips cropped to the active speaker's face. You'll learn how to build a complete production-ready SaaS with user authentication, a credit-based payment system using Stripe, and background processing queues to handle user load. All services used in this project are free, so you won't have to pay anything to follow along. We'll use technologies such as Next.js 15, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Auth.js, Python, FastAPI, Stripe, Modal, Inngest, S3 on AWS, and more\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 🎬 Auto-detection of viral moments in podcasts (stories, questions, etc.)\n- 🔊 Automatically added subtitles on clips\n- 📝 Transcription with m-bain/whisperX\n- 🎯 Active speaker detection for video cropping with Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD\n- 📱 Clips optimized for vertical platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts)\n- 🎞️ GPU-accelerated video rendering with FFMPEGCV\n- 🧠 LLM-powered viral moment identification with Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 📊 Queue system with Inngest for handling user load\n- 💳 Credit-based system\n- 💰 Stripe integration for credit pack purchases\n- 👤 User authentication system\n- 📱 Responsive Next.js web interface\n- 🎛️ Dashboard to upload podcasts and see clips\n- ⏱️ Inngest for handling long-running processes\n- ⚡ Serverless GPU processing with Modal\n- 🌐 FastAPI endpoint for podcast processing\n- 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI\n\n## Setup\n\nFollow these steps to install and set up the project.\n\n### Install Python\n\nDownload and install Python if not already installed. Use the link below for guidance on installation:\n[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\nCreate a virtual environment with **Python 3.12**.\n\n### Backend\n\nNavigate to backend folder:\n\n```bash\ncd ai-podcast-clipper-backend\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nClone the [LR-ASD](https://github.com/Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD) repo into the backend folder, and rename the folder asd:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD.git\n```\n\n### Local / Vast.ai Deployment (Active Speaker Detection)\n\nIf you are deploying this locally or on a GPU instance (like Vast.ai) without using Modal, you need to configure the Active Speaker Detection (ASD) module correctly.\n\n**ASD venv (required):**\n`scripts/setup_local_services.sh` installs ASD-only deps using `ASD_VENV_PY`. If the venv is missing, it will skip and ASD will fail at runtime.\n\nCreate the venv and install ASD deps:\n```bash\npython3 -m venv --system-site-packages ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/.venv\nai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/.venv/bin/pip install python_speech_features scenedetect torchvision\n```\n\n**Automated Setup:**\nThe recommended way is to use the provided setup script which handles dependencies, weights, and service startup:\n\n```bash\nbash scripts/setup_local_services.sh install\nbash scripts/setup_local_services.sh start\n```\n\n**Manual ASD Setup:**\nIf setting up manually, ensure the following:\n\n1.  **Clone ASD Repo:**\n    Place the `LR-ASD` repository in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd`.\n\n2.  **Download Weights:**\n    Download the S3FD face detector weights to `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/sfd_face.pth`.\n    ```bash\n    curl -L https://huggingface.co/lithiumice/syncnet/resolve/main/sfd_face.pth -o ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/sfd_face.pth\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    The ASD module requires specific packages not in the main requirements.txt:\n    ```bash\n    pip install python_speech_features scenedetect torchvision\n    ```\n\n4.  **Environment Variable:**\n    Set `ASD_DIR` to the absolute path of the `asd` directory in your environment variables or when running the worker.\n    ```bash\n    export ASD_DIR=/path/to/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd\n    ```\n\n## Video Processing System Summary\n\n### 1. Core Workflow\nThe system provides an automated pipeline for converting horizontal video into viral-ready vertical clips.\n\n- **Transcription & Alignment:** Uses **WhisperX** on the GPU to generate word-level timestamped transcripts.\n- **AI Moment Identification:** A local **Llama 3.2 (3B)** model evaluates the transcript to select the most engaging segments (5–120s).\n- **Active Speaker Detection (ASD):** Employs the `LR-ASD` model to track facial movements and identify the speaker.\n- **Dynamic Vertical Cropping:** Automatically reframes the 16:9 video into 9:16 by centering the active speaker.\n- **Automated Subtitling:** Generates karaoke-style `.ass` subtitles and burns them into the final clip using FFmpeg.\n- **Storage Integration:** Fully integrated with **MinIO** for input/output management.\n\n### 2. Modifications & Error Handling\nSpecific patches were applied to handle environment-specific bugs and modern library compatibility:\n\n- **NumPy 1.24+ Compatibility:** Fixed `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'` (and `np.float`) in the `LR-ASD` dependency by patching legacy NumPy calls to standard Python types in `box_utils.py` and evaluation utilities.\n- **PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where `weights_only=True` (the new default) prevented loading models with `OmegaConf` dependencies. \n- **Torchaudio/Pyannote Shim:** Monkey-patched `torchaudio` to provide missing backend attributes expected by legacy dependencies.\n- **Pre-emptive Short Clip Robustness:** Enhanced `main.py` to manually extract frames via FFmpeg *before* ASD processing. This allows the system to reliably skip the `LR-ASD` neural network for clips with fewer than 50 frames, preventing tensor dimension mismatches and worker crashes.\n- **FFmpeg Fallback:** Configured `pick_ffmpeg_video_encoder` to prioritize GPU-accelerated encoding (`h264_nvenc`) with an automatic fallback to CPU (`libx264`) if the GPU pipe is interrupted.\n- **Robust JSON Parsing:** Added a regex-like extraction logic to pull JSON arrays from conversational LLM responses, preventing parsing errors when the model includes extra text.\n- **ASD NumPy Hotfix:** If the ASD repo is cloned at runtime, `scripts/setup_local_services.sh` now auto-patches `np.int` → `int` in `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/box_utils.py` to prevent NumPy 1.24+ crashes.\n\n### 5. Local Ops Log (Condensed)\n- **WhisperX cache:** Pointed `WHISPER_MODEL_DIR` to `/workspace/packages/models/whisperx` and defaulted `WHISPER_MODEL_NAME` to `Systran/faster-whisper-large-v2` when cached.\n- **llama.cpp reuse:** `setup_local_services.sh` now prefers the existing llama.cpp checkout under `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/llama` and uses prebuilt `/app/llama-server` to avoid rebuilds.\n- **cuDNN loading:** Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH prep for cuDNN locations used by Torch/WhisperX.\n- **ASD NumPy fix:** Auto-applied patch for `np.int` in ASD to avoid crash during face detection.\n- **Vast image hardening:** Dockerfile now sets cached WhisperX defaults, adds cuDNN v8 compatibility libs, and allows flexible Torch CUDA wheels via `ARG TORCH_CUDA` (default `cu124`).\n- **GHCR build source:** GHCR workflow now builds from `Dockerfile.vast` so ASD/WhisperX fixes are baked into the image.\n- **ASD path alignment:** Default `ASD_DIR` now points to `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd`, and the entrypoint patches that path.\n\n### 3. Vast.ai Instance Configuration\n- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM)\n- **CUDA:** 12.8\n- **CPU:** Intel Xeon E5-1660 v3\n- **Disk:** 32GB (Overlay)\n\n#### Current Resource Status\n- **VRAM:** ~6.5GB used (Hosts WhisperX and LLM Server concurrently).\n- **Disk Space:** **72% Used (~9.1GB Free)**.\n    - *Note: Processing long videos may exhaust disk space during the frame extraction (JPEG) phase.*\n- **Performance:** CPU is effectively offloaded; inference and encoding are primarily handled by the RTX 3060.\n\n### 4. Operational Commands\n- **Start Services:** `bash ai-podcast-clipper-local/scripts/setup_local_services.sh start`\n- **Stop Services:** `bash ai-podcast-clipper-local/scripts/setup_local_services.sh stop`\n- **Monitor Progress:** `tail -f ai-podcast-clipper-local/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/worker.log`\n\n## Original Architecture vs New Architecture\n\n### Original Architecture\n- Backend: Modal (cloud GPU computing)\n- Job Queue: Inngest\n- AI Models: Gemini API, WhisperX on Modal\n- Storage: AWS S3\n- Authentication & Payments: NextAuth.js + Stripe\n\n### New Architecture\n- Backend: Local FastAPI service with GPU support\n- Job Queue: Temporal\n- AI Models: Local llama.cpp (gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M) + Local WhisperX\n- Storage: MinIO (local S3-compatible storage)\n- Authentication & Payments: Temporarily removed\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Backend Service\n- Created new local backend in `/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/`\n- Uses FastAPI with Temporal for workflow orchestration\n- Includes GPU acceleration for video processing\n- Replaces Modal cloud functions with local processing\n\n### Job Queue System\n- Removed Inngest integration completely\n- Added Temporal workflow and activity definitions\n- Implemented video processing workflow with transcription, clip identification, and video creation steps\n\n### Storage Layer\n- Migrated from AWS S3 to MinIO\n- Updated all S3 client calls to work with MinIO endpoints\n- Maintained S3-compatible API for seamless transition\n\n### AI Processing\n- Replaced Gemini API with local llama.cpp instance\n- Using gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M model for clip identification\n- Local WhisperX for audio transcription\n\n### Frontend Changes\n- Removed Inngest client and functions\n- Added Temporal client and workflow functions\n- Updated environment variables to support MinIO\n"}}

This was traced to a hardcoded `max_tokens` limit of 150 in `call_llm_server`.\n\n3.  **Fixing the AI Model:**\n    -   **Action:** Increased `max_tokens` from 150 to 4096 in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py`.\n    -   **Action:** Refined the system prompt to request \"ONLY clip ranges\" and exclude the verbose \"word\" field (though the model still included it, the token limit increase handled it).\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    -   Reran the workflow with `gemini/final_fix_test.mp4` and `gemini/rerun_test.mp4`.\n    -   **Result:** The logs showed valid JSON parsing and a clip (`clip_0`) with 228 frames (~9 seconds), which differed from the generic 482 frames (20 seconds) of the fallback logic.\n    -   **Conclusion:** The AI model is now successfully identifying clips. The system produces a mix of AI-identified clips (e.g., Clip 0) and fallback clips (Clip 1, Clip 2) to meet the 3-clip quota if the AI finds fewer than 3 moments.\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Log File:** `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/worker.log`\n- **LLM:** Gemma 2B (via llama.cpp)\n- **Token Limit:** Increased to 4096.\n- **Output Bucket:** `uploads` in MinIO (local).\n- **Workflow ID Prefix:** `gemini-video-processing-` (verified in `start_workflow.py`).\n\n## Status\nThe pipeline is fully functional. The \"same output\" behavior for some clips is expected fallback logic when the AI returns fewer than 3 candidates.\n"}}

(file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Running the Frontend\n```bash\ncd ai-podcast-clipper-frontend\nnpm install\ncp .env.example .env\n# Update .env with your local configuration\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Key Files Changed\n\n### New Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py` - New backend service\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/requirements.txt` - Backend dependencies\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/Dockerfile` - Backend container\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/temporal/client.ts` - Temporal client\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/temporal/workflows.ts` - Temporal workflows\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Updated types\n\n### Modified Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/actions/generation.ts` - Updated to use Temporal\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/actions/s3.ts` - Updated to use MinIO\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/package.json` - Removed Inngest, added Temporal\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/.env.example` - Updated environment variables\n\n### Removed Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/inngest/functions.ts`\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/inngest/client.ts`\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Re-integration of Authentication**: Plan to add back user authentication system\n2. **Payment System**: Re-implement payment processing for credits\n3. **Monitoring & Observability**: Add metrics and tracing for Temporal workflows\n4. **Optimization**: Fine-tune GPU utilization and processing times\n\n## Notes\n\n- The current implementation removes user authentication and payments temporarily\n- Processing times may vary depending on hardware capabilities\n- Make sure your GPU has enough VRAM to run both WhisperX and the LLM simultaneously\n- Consider using CPU-only processing if GPU resources are limited (much slower)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter CUDA-related errors:\n- Verify your NVIDIA drivers are up to date\n- Check that the nvidia-docker runtime is properly configured\n- Ensure your GPU has enough memory for the models\n\nIf MinIO connectivity fails:\n- Verify MinIO is running and accessible\n- Check that the endpoint is correctly configured in environment variables\n- Confirm that CORS settings allow requests from your frontend\n\n## Gemini CLI Session - Fix Summary (2026-01-29)\n\n### Issues Resolved\n\n1.  **Dependency Fixes:**\n    -   **ASD Module:** Created missing virtual environment and installed required packages (`python_speech_features`, `scenedetect`, `torchvision`).\n    -   **Code Patch:** Fixed `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'` in `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/box_utils.py` by replacing deprecated `np.int` with `int`.\n    -   **Tooling:** Created `scripts/upload_to_minio_boto3.py` to handle MinIO uploads using the existing `boto3` library instead of the missing `minio` package.\n\n2.  **AI Model Failure (JSON Truncation):**\n    -   **Root Cause:** The `call_llm_server` function had a strict `max_tokens` limit of 150. The local LLM (Gemma 2B) returned verbose word-level JSON arrays that exceeded this limit, resulting in truncated, invalid JSON responses.\n    -   **Symptom:** The workflow consistently logged \"Could not find JSON list in LLM response\" and fell back to generating generic 20-second transcript slices.\n    -   **Fix:** Increased `max_tokens` to **4096** in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py` to accommodate verbose responses. Updated the system prompt to explicitly request excluding the \"word\" field (though the model's adherence is variable, the token increase ensures robustness).\n\n### Outcome\nThe video processing pipeline now successfully uses the AI model to identify viral moments. In the final test, the AI identified a specific ~9-second clip (approx. 128s mark), while the fallback mechanism filled the remaining request quota with standard slices, explaining the mix of unique and generic timestamps.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The tool uses different AI models to transcribe the video, automatically detect the most engaging moments in podcasts and create clips cropped to the active speaker's face. You'll learn how to build a complete production-ready SaaS with user authentication, a credit-based payment system using Stripe, and background processing queues to handle user load. All services used in this project are free, so you won't have to pay anything to follow along. We'll use technologies such as Next.js 15, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Auth.js, Python, FastAPI, Stripe, Modal, Inngest, S3 on AWS, and more\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 🎬 Auto-detection of viral moments in podcasts (stories, questions, etc.)\n- 🔊 Automatically added subtitles on clips\n- 📝 Transcription with m-bain/whisperX\n- 🎯 Active speaker detection for video cropping with Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD\n- 📱 Clips optimized for vertical platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts)\n- 🎞️ GPU-accelerated video rendering with FFMPEGCV\n- 🧠 LLM-powered viral moment identification with Gemini 2.5 Pro\n- 📊 Queue system with Inngest for handling user load\n- 💳 Credit-based system\n- 💰 Stripe integration for credit pack purchases\n- 👤 User authentication system\n- 📱 Responsive Next.js web interface\n- 🎛️ Dashboard to upload podcasts and see clips\n- ⏱️ Inngest for handling long-running processes\n- ⚡ Serverless GPU processing with Modal\n- 🌐 FastAPI endpoint for podcast processing\n- 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI\n\n## Setup\n\nFollow these steps to install and set up the project.\n\n### Install Python\n\nDownload and install Python if not already installed. Use the link below for guidance on installation:\n[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\nCreate a virtual environment with **Python 3.12**.\n\n### Backend\n\nNavigate to backend folder:\n\n```bash\ncd ai-podcast-clipper-backend\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nClone the [LR-ASD](https://github.com/Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD) repo into the backend folder, and rename the folder asd:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Junhua-Liao/LR-ASD.git\n```\n\n### Local / Vast.ai Deployment (Active Speaker Detection)\n\nIf you are deploying this locally or on a GPU instance (like Vast.ai) without using Modal, you need to configure the Active Speaker Detection (ASD) module correctly.\n\n**ASD venv (required):**\n`scripts/setup_local_services.sh` installs ASD-only deps using `ASD_VENV_PY`. If the venv is missing, it will skip and ASD will fail at runtime.\n\nCreate the venv and install ASD deps:\n```bash\npython3 -m venv --system-site-packages ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/.venv\nai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/.venv/bin/pip install python_speech_features scenedetect torchvision\n```\n\n**Automated Setup:**\nThe recommended way is to use the provided setup script which handles dependencies, weights, and service startup:\n\n```bash\nbash scripts/setup_local_services.sh install\nbash scripts/setup_local_services.sh start\n```\n\n**Manual ASD Setup:**\nIf setting up manually, ensure the following:\n\n1.  **Clone ASD Repo:**\n    Place the `LR-ASD` repository in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd`.\n\n2.  **Download Weights:**\n    Download the S3FD face detector weights to `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/sfd_face.pth`.\n    ```bash\n    curl -L https://huggingface.co/lithiumice/syncnet/resolve/main/sfd_face.pth -o ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/sfd_face.pth\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    The ASD module requires specific packages not in the main requirements.txt:\n    ```bash\n    pip install python_speech_features scenedetect torchvision\n    ```\n\n4.  **Environment Variable:**\n    Set `ASD_DIR` to the absolute path of the `asd` directory in your environment variables or when running the worker.\n    ```bash\n    export ASD_DIR=/path/to/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd\n    ```\n\n## Video Processing System Summary\n\n### 1. Core Workflow\nThe system provides an automated pipeline for converting horizontal video into viral-ready vertical clips.\n\n- **Transcription & Alignment:** Uses **WhisperX** on the GPU to generate word-level timestamped transcripts.\n- **AI Moment Identification:** A local **Llama 3.2 (3B)** model evaluates the transcript to select the most engaging segments (5–120s).\n- **Active Speaker Detection (ASD):** Employs the `LR-ASD` model to track facial movements and identify the speaker.\n- **Dynamic Vertical Cropping:** Automatically reframes the 16:9 video into 9:16 by centering the active speaker.\n- **Automated Subtitling:** Generates karaoke-style `.ass` subtitles and burns them into the final clip using FFmpeg.\n- **Storage Integration:** Fully integrated with **MinIO** for input/output management.\n\n### 2. Modifications & Error Handling\nSpecific patches were applied to handle environment-specific bugs and modern library compatibility:\n\n- **NumPy 1.24+ Compatibility:** Fixed `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'` (and `np.float`) in the `LR-ASD` dependency by patching legacy NumPy calls to standard Python types in `box_utils.py` and evaluation utilities.\n- **PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where `weights_only=True` (the new default) prevented loading models with `OmegaConf` dependencies. \n- **Torchaudio/Pyannote Shim:** Monkey-patched `torchaudio` to provide missing backend attributes expected by legacy dependencies.\n- **Pre-emptive Short Clip Robustness:** Enhanced `main.py` to manually extract frames via FFmpeg *before* ASD processing. This allows the system to reliably skip the `LR-ASD` neural network for clips with fewer than 50 frames, preventing tensor dimension mismatches and worker crashes.\n- **FFmpeg Fallback:** Configured `pick_ffmpeg_video_encoder` to prioritize GPU-accelerated encoding (`h264_nvenc`) with an automatic fallback to CPU (`libx264`) if the GPU pipe is interrupted.\n- **Robust JSON Parsing:** Added a regex-like extraction logic to pull JSON arrays from conversational LLM responses, preventing parsing errors when the model includes extra text.\n- **ASD NumPy Hotfix:** If the ASD repo is cloned at runtime, `scripts/setup_local_services.sh` now auto-patches `np.int` → `int` in `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/box_utils.py` to prevent NumPy 1.24+ crashes.\n\n### 5. Local Ops Log (Condensed)\n- **WhisperX cache:** Pointed `WHISPER_MODEL_DIR` to `/workspace/packages/models/whisperx` and defaulted `WHISPER_MODEL_NAME` to `Systran/faster-whisper-large-v2` when cached.\n- **llama.cpp reuse:** `setup_local_services.sh` now prefers the existing llama.cpp checkout under `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/llama` and uses prebuilt `/app/llama-server` to avoid rebuilds.\n- **cuDNN loading:** Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH prep for cuDNN locations used by Torch/WhisperX.\n- **ASD NumPy fix:** Auto-applied patch for `np.int` in ASD to avoid crash during face detection.\n- **Vast image hardening:** Dockerfile now sets cached WhisperX defaults, adds cuDNN v8 compatibility libs, and allows flexible Torch CUDA wheels via `ARG TORCH_CUDA` (default `cu124`).\n- **GHCR build source:** GHCR workflow now builds from `Dockerfile.vast` so ASD/WhisperX fixes are baked into the image.\n- **ASD path alignment:** Default `ASD_DIR` now points to `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/asd`, and the entrypoint patches that path.\n\n### 3. Vast.ai Instance Configuration\n- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM)\n- **CUDA:** 12.8\n- **CPU:** Intel Xeon E5-1660 v3\n- **Disk:** 32GB (Overlay)\n\n#### Current Resource Status\n- **VRAM:** ~6.5GB used (Hosts WhisperX and LLM Server concurrently).\n- **Disk Space:** **72% Used (~9.1GB Free)**.\n    - *Note: Processing long videos may exhaust disk space during the frame extraction (JPEG) phase.*\n- **Performance:** CPU is effectively offloaded; inference and encoding are primarily handled by the RTX 3060.\n\n### 4. Operational Commands\n- **Start Services:** `bash ai-podcast-clipper-local/scripts/setup_local_services.sh start`\n- **Stop Services:** `bash ai-podcast-clipper-local/scripts/setup_local_services.sh stop`\n- **Monitor Progress:** `tail -f ai-podcast-clipper-local/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/worker.log`\n\n## Original Architecture vs New Architecture\n\n### Original Architecture\n- Backend: Modal (cloud GPU computing)\n- Job Queue: Inngest\n- AI Models: Gemini API, WhisperX on Modal\n- Storage: AWS S3\n- Authentication & Payments: NextAuth.js + Stripe\n\n### New Architecture\n- Backend: Local FastAPI service with GPU support\n- Job Queue: Temporal\n- AI Models: Local llama.cpp (gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M) + Local WhisperX\n- Storage: MinIO (local S3-compatible storage)\n- Authentication & Payments: Temporarily removed\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Backend Service\n- Created new local backend in `/ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/`\n- Uses FastAPI with Temporal for workflow orchestration\n- Includes GPU acceleration for video processing\n- Replaces Modal cloud functions with local processing\n\n### Job Queue System\n- Removed Inngest integration completely\n- Added Temporal workflow and activity definitions\n- Implemented video processing workflow with transcription, clip identification, and video creation steps\n\n### Storage Layer\n- Migrated from AWS S3 to MinIO\n- Updated all S3 client calls to work with MinIO endpoints\n- Maintained S3-compatible API for seamless transition\n\n### AI Processing\n- Replaced Gemini API with local llama.cpp instance\n- Using gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M model for clip identification\n- Local WhisperX for audio transcription\n\n### Frontend Changes\n- Removed Inngest client and functions\n- Added Temporal client and workflow functions\n- Updated environment variables to support MinIO\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Setting up Temporal\n```bash\ndocker-compose -f docker/temporal.yml up -d\n```\n\n### 3. Setting up Local LLM\nDownload the gemma-3-1b-it-Q4_K_M GGUF model and place it in the models directory.\n\n### 4. Running the Local Backend\n```bash\ncd ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend\ndocker build -t local-podcast-clipper .\ndocker run --gpus all -e MINIO_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:9000 local-podcast-clipper\n```\n\n### 5. Running the Frontend\n```bash\ncd ai-podcast-clipper-frontend\nnpm install\ncp .env.example .env\n# Update .env with your local configuration\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Key Files Changed\n\n### New Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py` - New backend service\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/requirements.txt` - Backend dependencies\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/Dockerfile` - Backend container\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/temporal/client.ts` - Temporal client\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/temporal/workflows.ts` - Temporal workflows\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Updated types\n\n### Modified Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/actions/generation.ts` - Updated to use Temporal\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/actions/s3.ts` - Updated to use MinIO\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/package.json` - Removed Inngest, added Temporal\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/.env.example` - Updated environment variables\n\n### Removed Files\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/inngest/functions.ts`\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/inngest/client.ts`\n- `ai-podcast-clipper-frontend/src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. **Re-integration of Authentication**: Plan to add back user authentication system\n2. **Payment System**: Re-implement payment processing for credits\n3. **Monitoring & Observability**: Add metrics and tracing for Temporal workflows\n4. **Optimization**: Fine-tune GPU utilization and processing times\n\n## Notes\n\n- The current implementation removes user authentication and payments temporarily\n- Processing times may vary depending on hardware capabilities\n- Make sure your GPU has enough VRAM to run both WhisperX and the LLM simultaneously\n- Consider using CPU-only processing if GPU resources are limited (much slower)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter CUDA-related errors:\n- Verify your NVIDIA drivers are up to date\n- Check that the nvidia-docker runtime is properly configured\n- Ensure your GPU has enough memory for the models\n\nIf MinIO connectivity fails:\n- Verify MinIO is running and accessible\n- Check that the endpoint is correctly configured in environment variables\n- Confirm that CORS settings allow requests from your frontend\n\n## Gemini CLI Session - Fix Summary (2026-01-29)\n\n### Issues Resolved\n\n1.  **Dependency Fixes:**\n    -   **ASD Module:** Created missing virtual environment and installed required packages (`python_speech_features`, `scenedetect`, `torchvision`).\n    -   **Code Patch:** Fixed `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'` in `asd/model/faceDetector/s3fd/box_utils.py` by replacing deprecated `np.int` with `int`.\n    -   **Tooling:** Created `scripts/upload_to_minio_boto3.py` to handle MinIO uploads using the existing `boto3` library instead of the missing `minio` package.\n\n2.  **AI Model Failure (JSON Truncation):**\n    -   **Root Cause:** The `call_llm_server` function had a strict `max_tokens` limit of 150. The local LLM (Gemma 2B) returned verbose word-level JSON arrays that exceeded this limit, resulting in truncated, invalid JSON responses.\n    -   **Symptom:** The workflow consistently logged \"Could not find JSON list in LLM response\" and fell back to generating generic 20-second transcript slices.\n    -   **Fix:** Increased `max_tokens` to **4096** in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py` to accommodate verbose responses. Updated the system prompt to explicitly request excluding the \"word\" field (though the model's adherence is variable, the token increase ensures robustness).\n\n### Outcome\nThe video processing pipeline now successfully uses the AI model to identify viral moments. In the final test, the AI identified a specific ~9-second clip (approx. 128s mark), while the fallback mechanism filled the remaining request quota with standard slices, explaining the mix of unique and generic timestamps.\n\n## Codex Session Notes (2026-01-29)\n\n### What Changed / Added\n- Added MinIO key normalization to avoid bad `HeadObject` errors when `uploads/` prefix is included.\n- Added WhisperX OOM resilience with batch-size fallback and `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` override.\n- Fixed output MinIO key generation to avoid leading `/` when input key has no directory.\n- Added transcript-only Temporal workflow (`ProcessTranscriptWorkflow`) and activity (`upload_clip_transcript`) that upload clip transcripts (with timestamps) instead of rendering video.\n- Added script: `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/start_transcript_workflow.py` to run the transcript-only workflow.\n- Added script: `scripts/test_identify_moments_llm.py` (supports `--minio-key` and mock LLM response, uploads transcript JSON to MinIO).\n- Added script: `scripts/test_pipeline_transcripts_only.py` (standalone run that outputs clip transcripts to MinIO as text).\n\n### Why `identify_moments` results differ across runs\n- The LLM call uses `temperature=0.2`, so responses are non-deterministic.\n- Transcript chunking + merging means small LLM differences can shift final clip boundaries.\n- Model mismatch risk: `LLM_MODEL_NAME` can differ from the actual model served by llama.cpp.\n- WhisperX + VAD can produce small timestamp variations, which affect snap-to-word boundaries.\n\n### Operational Notes (This Session)\n- Downloaded `Systran/faster-whisper-small` to `/workspace/packages/models/whisper`.\n- Recommended env for stability on RTX 3060:\n  - `WHISPER_MODEL_DIR=/workspace/packages/models/whisper`\n  - `WHISPER_MODEL_NAME=Systran/faster-whisper-small`\n  - `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8`\n  - `WHISPER_BATCH_SIZE=1`\n  - `LLAMA_N_GPU_LAYERS=0` (to free VRAM for WhisperX)\n\n### Temporal Transcript Workflow Example\n```\npython ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/start_transcript_workflow.py .small-rerun-original.mp4\n```\nOutputs (MinIO):\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_0.txt`\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_1.txt`\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_2.txt`\n\nEach transcript file starts with:\n```\nstart=...s end=...s\n```\n\n### MinIO Transcript JSON Example\n`test_identify_moments_llm.py --minio-key .small-rerun-original.mp4` uploads:\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original.json`\n\n### Rerun Strategy\nTemporal workflow IDs are unique; for reruns create new MinIO keys (e.g. `.small-rerun-2-original.mp4`) to avoid `workflow execution already completed` errors.\n"}}

This was traced to a hardcoded `max_tokens` limit of 150 in `call_llm_server`.\n\n3.  **Fixing the AI Model:**\n    -   **Action:** Increased `max_tokens` from 150 to 4096 in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py`.\n    -   **Action:** Refined the system prompt to request \"ONLY clip ranges\" and exclude the verbose \"word\" field (though the model still included it, the token limit increase handled it).\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    -   Reran the workflow with `gemini/final_fix_test.mp4` and `gemini/rerun_test.mp4`.\n    -   **Result:** The logs showed valid JSON parsing and a clip (`clip_0`) with 228 frames (~9 seconds), which differed from the generic 482 frames (20 seconds) of the fallback logic.\n    -   **Conclusion:** The AI model is now successfully identifying clips. The system produces a mix of AI-identified clips (e.g., Clip 0) and fallback clips (Clip 1, Clip 2) to meet the 3-clip quota if the AI finds fewer than 3 moments.\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Log File:** `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/worker.log`\n- **LLM:** Gemma 2B (via llama.cpp)\n- **Token Limit:** Increased to 4096.\n- **Output Bucket:** `uploads` in MinIO (local).\n- **Workflow ID Prefix:** `gemini-video-processing-` (verified in `start_workflow.py`).\n\n## Status\nThe pipeline is fully functional. The \"same output\" behavior for some clips is expected fallback logic when the AI returns fewer than 3 candidates.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>/ai-podcast-clipper-local</cwd>\n  <shell>bash</shell>\n</environment_context>"}]},{"type":"message","role":"developer","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"<permissions instructions>Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The local LLM (Gemma 2B) returned verbose word-level JSON arrays that exceeded this limit, resulting in truncated, invalid JSON responses.\n    -   **Symptom:** The workflow consistently logged \"Could not find JSON list in LLM response\" and fell back to generating generic 20-second transcript slices.\n    -   **Fix:** Increased `max_tokens` to **4096** in `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/main.py` to accommodate verbose responses. Updated the system prompt to explicitly request excluding the \"word\" field (though the model's adherence is variable, the token increase ensures robustness).\n\n### Outcome\nThe video processing pipeline now successfully uses the AI model to identify viral moments. In the final test, the AI identified a specific ~9-second clip (approx. 128s mark), while the fallback mechanism filled the remaining request quota with standard slices, explaining the mix of unique and generic timestamps.\n\n## Codex Session Notes (2026-01-29)\n\n### What Changed / Added\n- Added MinIO key normalization to avoid bad `HeadObject` errors when `uploads/` prefix is included.\n- Added WhisperX OOM resilience with batch-size fallback and `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` override.\n- Fixed output MinIO key generation to avoid leading `/` when input key has no directory.\n- Added transcript-only Temporal workflow (`ProcessTranscriptWorkflow`) and activity (`upload_clip_transcript`) that upload clip transcripts (with timestamps) instead of rendering video.\n- Added script: `ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/start_transcript_workflow.py` to run the transcript-only workflow.\n- Added script: `scripts/test_identify_moments_llm.py` (supports `--minio-key` and mock LLM response, uploads transcript JSON to MinIO).\n- Added script: `scripts/test_pipeline_transcripts_only.py` (standalone run that outputs clip transcripts to MinIO as text).\n\n### Why `identify_moments` results differ across runs\n- The LLM call uses `temperature=0.2`, so responses are non-deterministic.\n- Transcript chunking + merging means small LLM differences can shift final clip boundaries.\n- Model mismatch risk: `LLM_MODEL_NAME` can differ from the actual model served by llama.cpp.\n- WhisperX + VAD can produce small timestamp variations, which affect snap-to-word boundaries.\n\n### Operational Notes (This Session)\n- Downloaded `Systran/faster-whisper-small` to `/workspace/packages/models/whisper`.\n- Recommended env for stability on RTX 3060:\n  - `WHISPER_MODEL_DIR=/workspace/packages/models/whisper`\n  - `WHISPER_MODEL_NAME=Systran/faster-whisper-small`\n  - `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8`\n  - `WHISPER_BATCH_SIZE=1`\n  - `LLAMA_N_GPU_LAYERS=0` (to free VRAM for WhisperX)\n\n### Temporal Transcript Workflow Example\n```\npython ai-podcast-clipper-local-backend/start_transcript_workflow.py .small-rerun-original.mp4\n```\nOutputs (MinIO):\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_0.txt`\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_1.txt`\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original/clip_2.txt`\n\nEach transcript file starts with:\n```\nstart=...s end=...s\n```\n\n### MinIO Transcript JSON Example\n`test_identify_moments_llm.py --minio-key .small-rerun-original.mp4` uploads:\n- `uploads/transcripts/.small-rerun-original.json`\n\n### Rerun Strategy\nTemporal workflow IDs are unique; for reruns create new MinIO keys (e.g. `.small-rerun-2-original.mp4`) to avoid `workflow execution already completed` errors.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
